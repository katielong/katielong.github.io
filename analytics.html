	<h2>Analytics</h2>
	<p>Below is a list of recent analytic projects that I have worked on. They ranged from projects focusing on health problems among underserved populations, to projects related to land policy issues, and others that I have done just for fun!</p>

			<h3>HIV Testing Acceptance</h3>	
			</a>
			<h4>Tawandra L. Rowell-Cunsolo, Yamnia I. Cortes, Yue Long, Erida Castro-Rivas, Jianfang Liu</h4>
			<p>We used cox regression with constant time variable to calculate risk ratios in measuring association between factors and outcome at the both bivariate and multivariate levels. Results indicated that participants who were reportedly somewhat or very religious were less likely than those who were less religious to undergo rapid HIV testing. Partcipants who were reportedly tested for HIV withiin the past year were also less likely to accept the HIV testing offer than those who had not been tested within the past year. This study was funded by Columbia University. </p>

			<a><h3>Housing Price, Residential Land Price and Residential Land Sales in China</h3>	
			</a>
			<h4>Huina Gao, Zhi Liu, Yue Long</h4>
			<p> Two topics were explored for this project: the interaction between housing and residential land price, and the relationship between residential land price and land sales. Using a simulatanoues-equations model, we examined the interaction between housing price and residential land price, and with the fixed effects model, we examined the influence of government's restriction in land sales on residential land price. Results indicated that for each percentage increase in residential land price, housing price increased by about 0.05%; and for each percentage increase in housing price, residential land price increased by about 1.16%. Moreover, for each percentage decrease in new land sales, land price increased by 0.17%, and this influence was significant among non-major cities (0.19%) and not significant among major cities (0.03%).

			<h3>Using Random Forest to examine factors associated with unprotected sexual behavior among Black Americans post-release from incarceration in New York</h3>	
			</a>
			<h4>Tawandra L. Rowell-Cunsolo, Yue Long, Betsy Szeto, Rahma Mkuu, and Nabila El-Bassel</h4>
			<p> For this study, we assessed the extent to which post-incarcerated Black Americans are engaging in risk behavior. We conducted both log-binomial regression and random forest to assess factors associated with unprotected sexual behavior. Results indicated that illicit drug use was a predictor of unprotected sexual behavior, especially cocaine usage. Random forest results demonstrated that total time in jail and cocaine usage were among the most important variables associated with unprotected sexual behavior. </p>
