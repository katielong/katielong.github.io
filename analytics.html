	<h2>Analytics</h2>
	<p>Below is a list of recent analytics that I have worked on. They ranged from research projects that I have worked on as a research assistant at Columbia, to research project doen as an intern, and others that I have done just for fun!</p>

			<h3 href="#">HIV Testing Acceptance</h3>	</a>
			<h4>Tawandra L. Rowell-Cunsolo, Yamnia I. Cortes, Yue Long, Erida Castro-Rivas, Jianfang Liu</h4>
			<p>We used cox regression with constant time variable to calculate risk ratios in measuring association between factors and outcome at the both bivariate and multivariate levels. Results indicated that participants who were reportedly somewhat or very religious were less likely than those who were less religious to undergo rapid HIV testing. Partcipants who were reportedly tested for HIV withiin the past year were also less likely to accept the HIV testing offer than those who had not been tested within the past year. </p>
